The following is the NoSQL/Firebase database structure for our project. 
There are a few differences between this design and the relational database design that make this design a bit nicer.
This is not quite a direct translation from the relational model, but an overall improvement in design.

Notes:
	- no "Journey History": all data will be pulled straight from "journeys" when "completed" value is set to true

	- added "pickups" to store pickup locations of passengers for each journey. This is not nested in "journeys" 
	  because we want to keep the data shallow allowing quicker referencing (a Firebase nuance/advantage for read data speed)

	- "first_name" and "last_name" condensed into "full_name"

	- added "username" field: this can be used for adding friends by username, which is nicer than email

	- "user1", "user2" etc.. will be a Firebase generated userID after authenticated account creation
	  Example: '-JglJnGDXcqLq6m844pZ'

Data types:
	--users--
	"user1": userID
	username: string
	email: string
	full_name: string
	journeys: boolean

	--journeys--
	"journey1": journeyID
	journey_name: string
	no_of_users: integer
	driver: userID
	meeting_address: string
	destination_address: string
	date: string
	time: string
	completed: boolean
	total_cost: float
	distance_miles: float 
	members: userID

	--pickups--
	"journey1": journeyID
	"user1": userID
	pickup_address: string

	--friendships--
	"user1": userID
	"anotherUserID": boolean 	--> this is a link between two userIDs. If a link is present then the users are friends.
